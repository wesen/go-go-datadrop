// Package events holds the three verbs that read a stream: query, tail and
// export.
//
// query and tail return records and are Glaze commands. export returns bytes
// the server formatted and is a Writer command (DR-75) — which is why this
// package is the one place where the --format / --output distinction is
// concrete rather than theoretical. --format names a server-side export
// format; --output names the client-side rendering of rows a command emitted.
// No command here has both.
