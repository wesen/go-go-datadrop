// Package drops holds the four verbs that act on a drop as a whole: create,
// list, inspect and push.
//
// The package groups them in the source without grouping them in the CLI —
// they stay top-level verbs, `datadrop list` rather than `datadrop drops list`,
// because that is the existing surface and this is not a renaming ticket
// (DR-82).
