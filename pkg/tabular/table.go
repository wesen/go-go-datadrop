// Package tabular is the single projection from a datadrop source to a table.
//
// A chart does not consume "a stream" or "a dataset". It consumes a table: an
// ordered list of named, typed columns plus rows. Both of datadrop's storage
// shapes — the append-only event log and the immutable dataset version — reduce
// to that one type here, on the server, and nowhere else.
//
// The constraint that gives the package its value is that it is the *only*
// place the reduction happens. See DATADROP-3 guide §2 and DR-1: a second
// implementation in the browser would be a second answer to "what are the
// columns", with nothing forcing the two to agree.
//
// This package imports pkg/datadrop and nothing else from this repository. In
// particular it does not import pkg/store, so its tests link no SQLite driver
// and run against literals.
