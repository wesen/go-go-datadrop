# Agent Guidelines for go-go-golems go projects

## Build Commands

- Run a binary in cmd/go-go-datadrop: `go run ./cmd/go-go-datadrop` . Use this instead of build + ./go-go-datadrop.
- Build: `go build ./...`
- Test: `go test ./...`
- Run single test: `go test ./pkg/path/to/package -run TestName`
- Generate: `go generate ./...`
- Lint: `golangci-lint run -v` or `make lint`
- Format: `go fmt ./...`

IMPORTANT: To run a server and do some interaction with it, use tmux, this makes it very easy to kill a server.
Use capture-pane to read the output.

## Project Structure

- `cmd/`: CLI commands and entry points
- `pkg/`: Library code organized by domain
- `examples/`: Example configurations and usage
- `doc/`: Documentation
- `ttmp/YYYY-MM-DD/`: this is where all temporary documentation as well as debugging logs and other reports go

<runningProcessesGuidelines>
- When testing TUIs, use tmux and capture-pane to interact with the UI.
- When using tmux, try to batch as many commands as possible when using send-keys.
- When running long-running processes (servers, etc...), use tmux to more easily interact and kill them.
- Kill a process using port $PORT: `lsof-who -p $PORT -k`. When building a web server, ALWAYS use this command to kill the process.
</runningProcessesGuidelines>

<goGuidelines>
- When implementing go interfaces, use the var _ Interface = &Foo{} to make sure the interface is always implemented correctly.
- Always use a context argument when appropriate.
- Use glazed command framework for command-line applications.
- Use the "defaults" package name, instead of "default" package name, as it's reserved in go.
- Use github.com/pkg/errors for wrapping errors.
- When starting goroutines, use errgroup.

- Only use the toplevel go.mod, don't create new ones.
- When writing a new experiment / app, add zerolog logging to help debug and figure out how it works, add --log-level flag to set the log level.
- When using go:embed, import embed as `_ "embed"`
- When using build tagged features, make sure the software compiles without the tag as well
</goGuidelines>

<libraryGuidelines>
- when interfacing with the google gemini/genai APIs, use the new https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/genai package
</libraryGuidelines>

<webGuidelines>
- Use bun, react and rtk-query. Use typescript.
- Store css, html and js in different files in a static directory.
- Use go:embed to serve static files.
- Always serve static files under /static/ URL paths, never directly under functional paths like /admin/
</webGuidelines>

<diaryGuidelines>
ALWAYS keep a detailed diary while working on a ticket, and ALWAYS commit at
appropriate intervals. This is not optional and it is not something to be
remembered only when asked. Do it from the first step, not retroactively at the
end — a backfilled diary loses exactly the thing it exists to capture, which is
what was tried and did not work.

- Load the `diary` skill for the required step format. Every step needs the
  prose paragraphs, the `Prompt Context` block with the user's prompt verbatim,
  and the `What didn't work` / `What was tricky to build` /
  `What warrants a second pair of eyes` sections.
- The diary lives in the ticket: `docmgr doc add --ticket TICKET --doc-type reference --title "Diary"`.
- The working loop per step: implement, format, test, commit the code, check the
  task with `docmgr task check`, write the diary step with the commit hash,
  update the changelog with `docmgr changelog update`, commit the docs.
- Record failures with the exact error text, the command and the version. A step
  that only records what worked is a step that will be repeated by the next
  person hitting the same wall.
- Commit at intervals that make `git diff` reviewable: one commit per phase or
  per coherent change, never one commit at the end of a day's work.
</diaryGuidelines>

<debuggingGuidelines>
If me or you the LLM agent seem to go down too deep in a debugging/fixing rabbit hole in our conversations, remind me to take a breath and think about the bigger picture instead of hacking away. Say: "I think I'm stuck, let's TOUCH GRASS".  IMPORTANT: Don't try to fix errors by yourself more than twice in a row. Then STOP. Don't do anything else.

</debuggingGuidelines>

<generalGuidelines>
Don't add backwards compatibility layers or adapters unless explicitly asked. If you think there is a need for a backwards compatibility or adapting to an existing interface, STOP AND ASK ME IF THAT IS NECESSARY. Usually, I don't need backwards compatibility.

If it looks like your edits aren't applied, stop immediately and say "STOPPING BECAUSE EDITING ISN'T WORKING".
</generalGuidelines>
